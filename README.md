# Setup

After inviting the bot to your server with the link [here](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=523282498265022479&permissions=337984&scope=bot), **Use `~help` for initial help**. 

Should you have questions on how to use a command, use `~help [command]`. Otherwise, the bot will automatically display help for the command in the event you incorrectly used a command.

Note that the default prefix `~` can be changed by the guild owner. If the default bot prefix does not work @mention the bot and it will reply with the prefix for the guild you are in.
