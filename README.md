# UncrateGO

**NOTE** As of May 4, 2020 this bot is no longer running.

Reasons are as follows: 
- Discord.NET's issues with intermittent gateway disconnects
- My lack of experience surrounding C# and general programming concepts at the time

The above leading to a poor performing and difficult to maintain bot. I thus believe other alternatives would be better suited.

It has been a great journey for the past year, and I have advanced further in programming since that time. Perhaps the bot will be reborn someday, but for now, this is its end.

* Custom Guild/Server prefix, default is `~` and can be changed by server owner

# Setup

After inviting the bot to your server with the link [here](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=523282498265022479&permissions=339008&scope=bot), **Use `~help` for initial help**. 

Should you have questions on how to use a command, use `~help [command]`. Otherwise, the bot will automatically display help for the command in the event you incorrectly used a command.

Note that the default prefix `~` can be changed by the guild owner. If the default bot prefix does not work @mention the bot and it will reply with the prefix for the guild you are in.

# FAQ

### The bot does not respond to commands / only certain commands

Ensure the bot has sufficient permissions for the channel you wish to use the bot in. Try giving the bot **administrator** permissions.
